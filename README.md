# Ising-Type-Prediction-Toolkit
Monte Carlo simulation toolkit for 2D Ising models, extending from NN and NNN couplings to RKKY long-range interactions. Includes Metropolis and annealing implementations for tracking phase transitions and thermodynamic observables.
1. Introduction

This repository contains my independent implementations of 2D Ising-type models as part of the Ising-Type Prediction Toolkit project.
The focus is on extending classical Ising models from nearest-neighbor (NN) coupling to next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) and long-range RKKY interactions, using Monte Carlo simulations.

My contributions include both algorithmic development and physical analysis of phase transitions.
